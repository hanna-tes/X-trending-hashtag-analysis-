**The Role of Social Media**

During the Ethiopia war, which started in November 2020, social media became a battleground, with both Ethiopian government supporters and Tigrayan activists using platforms to disseminate their perspectives. The widespread dissemination of misinformation and propaganda further complicated the situation, affecting civilians in conflict zones.
